# Locker Coding Challenge

### Description

- I've included challenge.json file as a data snapshot from a popular sports data provider. It includes the final day's data for the **Waste Management Phoenix Open** PGA golf event that ended Feb 7 of 2021, and is representative of the sort of data our providers make available to us through their various API calls.
- Take 10-15 minutes to become familiar with the unique layout and content of the data before beginning with the tasks and bonus items.
- You should not spend more than 90-120 minutes on this task. It is relatively deep but represents a significant portion of what data manipulation and presentation looks like on a day-to-day basis. The bonus items are extended goal tasks and may be more difficult depending on your comfort level with this form of data manipulation.
- You can use any language you are comfortable with.

### Tasks

1. Load and transform the data into a more useful data set, excluding all unnecessary data.

2. Create a simple web or native app (React, React Native, or any other popular framework) that displays the players in a table including the following information:

3. 1. Position
   2. Player Name
   3. Total Score
   4. Totals for each of the 4 rounds
   5. Total strokes taken

4. Create a simple readme with install / usage instructions

### Bonus

1. Sortable headers
2. Search for players
3. Typescript and Types 

There are no right or wrong solutions to this task. Once complete, create a public repo on Github or Zip your solution and email me your solution. Please do not hesitate to ask me any questions.

Good luck and good coding.
